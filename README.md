# Static Traffic Light

This project implements a static representation of a traffic light using HTML and CSS.

## Description

The project displays a traffic light with three lights: red, yellow, and green. The styling is done to resemble a standard traffic light appearance.

## Files

* `index.html`: This file provides the HTML structure of the traffic light. It includes the main container and the individual divs for each light.
* `style.css`: This file contains the CSS rules for styling the traffic light, including colors, sizes, spacing, and overall appearance.

## HTML Structure (`index.html`)

The HTML file sets up the basic layout:

* A main `div` with the ID "traffic" acts as the container for the traffic light.
* Three inner `div` elements with classes "red", "yellow", and "green" represent the individual lights.
* Basic heading is included.

## CSS Styling (`style.css`)

The CSS file styles the traffic light:

* The `#traffic` container is styled with dimensions, background color, border, and text properties.
* The `.red`, `.yellow`, and `.green` classes define the styling for each light, including color, size, shape, and spacing.
